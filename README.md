# nfc-scanner
This application was built on the ST25-series NFC chips API (open-source), extending capabilities from single-byte to multi-byte data transfers for electric motor integration.
It introduced synchronized read/write operations that present processed data directly during reading, eliminating the need for manual memory address selection and raw data handling.
The app has also been optimized for 50% lower memory usage and redesigned with improved UI/UX for faster and more user-friendly operation.
